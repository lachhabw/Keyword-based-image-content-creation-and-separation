Hello,

This repository contains the following:

+ **models** folder: It includes the Unet model for cifar10 and GANs for both cifar10 and CUB-200 datasets.

+ **GANs & Diffusion.ipynb**: This notebook allows you to utilize the aforementioned models and observe their generated outputs.

+ **image-generation-and-separation-stable-diffusion.ipynb**: This notebook provides the final solution, enabling you to generate, locate, and inpaint images using stable diffusion.

To learn how to use the last notebook effectively, you can refer to the tutorial available at:
